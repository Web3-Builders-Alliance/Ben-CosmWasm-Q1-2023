## Deployed contracts

White Whale Migaloo is a protocol that exists across multiple chains. You can find contract addresses for different
chain deployments
in the [documentation](https://ww0-1.gitbook.io/migaloo-docs/smart-contracts/deployments).

## Building and Deploying Migaloo

To build and deploy Migaloo's smart contracts, there are a series of deployment scripts under `scripts/`. You need at
least Rust v1.65.0 to compile the contracts.

### Build scripts

- `build_release.sh`: builds the project artifacts, optimized for production.
- `build_schemas.sh`: generates schemas for the contracts.
- `check_artifacts_size.sh`: validates the size of the optimized artifacts. The default maximum size is 600 kB, though
  it is customizable by passing the number of kB to the script. For example `check_artifacts_size.sh 400` verifies the
  artifacts are under 400 kB.

### Deployment scripts

The deployment scripts are found under `scripts/deployment/`. The following is the structure found on under this folder:

```bash
.
├── deploy_env
│   ├── base.env
│   ├── chain_env.sh
│   ├── mainnets
│   │   ├── chihuahua.env
│   │   ├── juno.env
│   │   └── terra.env
│   ├── mnemonics
│   │   ├── deployer_mnemonic_testnet.txt
│   │   └── deployer_mnemonic.txt
│   └── testnets
│       ├── archway.env
│       ├── injective.env
│       ├── juno.env
│       ├── local.env
│       └── terra.env
├── deploy_liquidity_hub.sh
├── deploy_pool.sh
├── deploy_vault.sh
├── input
│   ├── pool.json
│   └── vault.json
├── output
│   ├── uni-5_liquidity_hub_contracts.json
│   ├── uni-5_pools.json
│   └── uni-5_vaults.json
└── wallet_importer.sh
```

There are three main scripts: `deploy_liquidity_hub.sh`, `deploy_pool.sh` and `deploy_vault.sh`. The rest of the scripts
in there are used as auxiliary scripts by the main three listed before.

The `deploy_env/` folder contains env files defining the parameters for the blockchain where the deployment is going to
occur,
whether it is a mainnet or testnet deployment.

The `input/` folder is used for adding json files containing the config parameters when deploying pools or vaults.
The `output/` folder is where the scripts will write the data regarding the deployment, in json format. The name of the
file
follows the following nomenclature: `"chain_id"_liquidity_hub_contracts`, `"chain_id"_pools`, `"chain_id"_vaults`.

- `deploy_liquidity_hub.sh`: deploys the liquidity hubs. It can deploy the entire LH or parts of it. To learn how to use
  it,
  run the script with the `-h` flag.
- `deploy_pool.sh`: deploys a pool based on the configuration specified at `input/pool.json`. To learn how to use it,
  run the script with the `-h` flag.
- `deploy_vault.sh`: deploys a vault based on the configuration specified at `input/vault.json`. To learn how to use it,
  run the script with the `-h` flag.

Notice that to deploy a pool or vault you need to have deployed the pool or vault factory respectively.

Here are some examples:

```bash
scripts/deployment/deploy_liquidity_hub.sh -c juno -d all
scripts/deployment/deploy_liquidity_hub.sh -c juno -d vault-network
scripts/deployment/deploy_pool-sh -c juno -p scripts/deployment/input/pool.json
scripts/deployment/deploy_vault-sh -c juno -v scripts/deployment/input/vault.json
```

## Testing Migaloo

To run the tests, run `cargo test`. You can also run `cargo tarpaulin -v` to get test code coverage.

## Disclaimer

**Use the contracts and the White Whale app at your own risk!**

## Audit

Migaloo core contracts have been audited by [SCV-Security](https://www.scv.services/). The report can be
found [here](https://github.com/SCV-Security/PublicReports/blob/main/CW/WhiteWhale/White%20Whale%20-%20Migaloo%20Audit%20Report%20v1.0.pdf).
