# TerraSwap Token

This is a basic implementation of the cw20 contract with expanded name and symbol range. It implements
the [CW20 spec](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus/tree/master/packages/cw20) and is designed to
be deployed as is, or imported into other contracts to easily build cw20-compatible tokens with custom logic.

Implements:

- [x] CW20 Base
- [ ] Mintable extension
- [ ] Allowances extension
