/*
Cluster 2 Challenge ðŸ˜ˆ

You need two actors, Sender and Receiver.

The Sender:
- Receives native tokens from anyone and forwards them to the Receiver.
    An address, which takes any generic token and forwards it to the receiver.
- Stores how much tokens have been received/forwarded, which can be returned in a Query.
    saves to state the info.funds it has received and forwarded

The Receiver:
- Stores the received tokens until the owner of the contract claims them.
    Accepts tokens of any generic type, found in the info.funds
- The owner can claim part of the tokens held by the Receiver, or all at once.
    owner is the admin of the contract? and can claim from the receiver

Optional:
- The Sender gets notified when the Receiver has transferred the funds.
- The Sender gets notified when the Receiver funds have been claimed by its owner.
Assume happy paths, though minor validations are expected. Pass any relevant information you need on the messages.
